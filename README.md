## SubsCrypt for Providers
Let's assume that Sam is a VPN provider. He owns a website on which he provides different VPN subscription plans such as VIP, Premium, etc with different durations such as 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, and so on. In order to access services on Sam's website, users have to create an account. Then for purchases, Sam uses PayPal which allows users to pay easily. However, he was forced to use a database to keep track of user payments and both Sam and the users had to trust the service that PayPal provides.

Today, Sam has decided to try using SubsCrypt. For starting, he has to register as a provider on our website. Then he will have access to his personal dashboard where he can manage all his subscription plans by adding new plans or disabling old ones. He can also check the number of users who have purchased each of his plans.

Every time any user makes a purchase, the refund amount will be kept in the contract's wallet and the rest of the money will be directly sent to Sam's wallet. After the subscription duration is over or a user requests a refund, an amount of money might be left in the contract's wallet. Through his dashboard, Sam can check the amount of money he can receive, left from different subscriptions, and request to have it back, so after his request, the money will be sent to his wallet.

For all this procedure to be working well, all Sam needs to do is to use our API and payment pop-up page to let the users pay for subscriptions through his web page by cryptocurrencies.

The pop-up page will look like below:

## SubsCrypt for Customers
Sara is concerned about her privacy so she decides to buy a 1 month VPN service from Sam. She wants to be anonymous so when she finds out that Sam accepts cryptocurrencies as a method of payment she chooses SubsCrypt over PayPal on Sam's website. After Sara chooses her plan on Sam's website, SubsCrypt pop-up page will be opened and she can check the details of the payment, then she has to enter a token and a passphrase that identifies her on SubsCrypt from now on. Then she can pay through her online wallet for her subscription.

From now on Sara can use the VPN service she has purchased by using her token and passphrase; she can also use her token and passphrase to login to our website; there she can see her dashboard which allows her to manage all her subscription in one place, she can renew her subscription or request a refund for them on her dashboard.

Sara's dashboard looks like the following:
