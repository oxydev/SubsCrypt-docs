UI dashboards for users and providers and admins and ES6 Modules for developers for easier integrations.

## BackEnd RestAPI and wrapper libraries

In the third milestone, we will provide a RestAPI for who wants to connect easily to the contract.
Also We will provide some library to make integration of our service easier in different backend stacks by connecting to our Backend RestAPI.
